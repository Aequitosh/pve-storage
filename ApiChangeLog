# API Versioning ChangeLog

Our API versioning contains an `APIVER` and an `APIAGE`.
The `APIAGE` is the number of versions we're backward compatible with. (iow.  things got added
without breaking anything unaware of it.)

Future changes should be documented in here.

##  Version 10:

* a new `rename_volume` method has been added

  Storage plugins with rename support need to enable
  the `rename` feature flag; e.g. in the `volume_has_feature` method.

* Replace `volume_snapshot_list` with `volume_snapshot_info`:

  `volume_snapshot_list` was used exclusively by replication and currently, replication is only
  allowed for the storage type `zfspool`. Thus, no external plugins should be affected by this
  change and `APIAGE` is *not* reset.

  `volume_snapshot_info` returns a hash with snapshot names as keys and `id` and `timestamp` data
  for each snapshot, rather than just an array of snaphsot names like `volume_snapshot_list` did.

* Add `blockers` parameter to `volume_rollback_is_possible`:

  The parameter *can* be used to return a list of snapshots that is currently preventing rollback.

* Replace get/update_volume_notes with generic get/update_volume_attribute

  falling back to the old implementation for notes until we reset APIAGE. the
  new method optionally also supports querying/setting a protected flag.

##  Version 9: (AGE resets to 0):

* volume_import_formats gets a new parameter *inserted*:

  Old signature:
      sub($plugin, $scfg, $storeid, $volname, $base_snapshot, $with_snapshots)
  New signature:
      sub($plugin, $scfg, $storeid, $volname, $snapshot, $base_snapshot, $with_snapshots)

  This is now the same as `volume_export_formats`.

  The same goes for calls to `PVE::Storage::volume_import_formats`, which now
  takes a `$snapshot` parameter in the same place.

* $with_snapshots *may* now be an array reference containing an ordered list of
  snapshots, but *may* also just be a boolean, and the contained list *may* be
  ignored, so it can still be treated as a boolean.
