# API Versioning ChangeLog

Our API versioning contains an `APIVER` and an `APIAGE`.
The `APIAGE` is the number of versions we're backward compatible with. (iow.  things got added
without breaking anything unaware of it.)

Future changes should be documented in here.

##  Version 9: (AGE resets to 0):

* volume_import_formats gets a new parameter *inserted*:

  Old signature:
      sub($plugin, $scfg, $storeid, $volname, $base_snapshot, $with_snapshots)
  New signature:
      sub($plugin, $scfg, $storeid, $volname, $snapshot, $base_snapshot, $with_snapshots)

  This is now the same as `volume_export_formats`.

  The same goes for calls to `PVE::Storage::volume_import_formats`, which now
  takes a `$snapshot` parameter in the same place.

* $with_snapshots *may* now be an array reference containing an ordered list of
  snapshots, but *may* also just be a boolean, and the contained list *may* be
  ignored, so it can still be treated as a boolean.
